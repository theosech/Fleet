This cute kind of inference keeps a body of N top hypotheses, and successively proposes to them using standard proposals. When it hasn\textquotesingle{}t improved in ctl.\+restart steps, it will restart (resample). Note that this really should use ctl.\+restart$>$0, or else you just climb up one hill. N\+O\+TE\+: We could propose propotional to each hypothesis\textquotesingle{} posterior, but it doesn\textquotesingle{}t matter much because the best gets most probability mass (that\textquotesingle{}s why we don\textquotesingle{}t store more than n=1 defaultly)
