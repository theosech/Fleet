\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A concurrent queue class that allows multiple threads to push and consume. Note that this has a fixed, finite size (n) and when its full, we\textquotesingle{}ll block. This prevents us from eating up too much memory. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Many things in Fleet are stacks and this is designed to allow for rapid changse to the stack type in order to improve speed. std\+::stack appears to be slow. Using vector with some wrappers is faster. Also, vector is great because it allows us to reference the top. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
