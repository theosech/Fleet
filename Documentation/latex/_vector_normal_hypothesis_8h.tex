A \mbox{\hyperlink{class_t_normal_variable}{T\+Normal\+Variable}} encapsulates M\+C\+MC operations on a single real number with a standard normal prior. This is useful for variables in e.\+g. Grammar\+Inference. This has a normal prior on a parameter and then allows an output transformation, which is cached for speed.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A \mbox{\hyperlink{class_t_normal_variable}{T\+Normal\+Variable}} encapsulates M\+C\+MC operations on a single real number with a standard normal prior. This is useful for variables in e.\+g. Grammar\+Inference. This has a normal prior on a parameter and then allows an output transformation, which is cached for speed. 

This has all of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_m_c_m_cable}{M\+C\+M\+Cable}} interfaces but jsut represents n unit Gaussians. This is primarily used in Grammar\+Inference to represent parameters, but it could be used in any other too.

Half-\/normal hypothese are bounded at zero, normal proposals wrap around.

Distribution on half-\/normals. Man, it was a pain to try to make this inherit from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_vector_normal_hypothesis}{Vector\+Normal\+Hypothesis}}.
